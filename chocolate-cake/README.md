Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined.
In a separate mixing bowl, beat the eggs until light and fluffy. Add in the milk, vegetable oil or melted butter, and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.
Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until the batter is smooth.
Pour in the hot water and stir until it is fully incorporated into the batter.
Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
Once cooled, frost and decorate the cake as desired.
